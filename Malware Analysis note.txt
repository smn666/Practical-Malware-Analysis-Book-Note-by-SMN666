Using Other PE File Tools : 
Many other tools are available for browsing a PE header. Two of the mostuseful tools are PEBrowse Professional and PE Explorer.
PEBrowse Professional (http://www.smidgeonsoft.prohosting.com/pebrowsepro-file-viewer.html) is similar to PEview. It allows you to look at the bytes from each section and shows the parsed data. PEBrowse Professional does the better
job of presenting information from the resource (.rsrc) section.
PE Explorer (http://www.heaventools.com/) has a rich GUI that allows you to navigate through the various parts of the PE file. You can edit certain parts of the PE file, and its included resource editor is great for browsing and editing
the file’s resources. The tool’s main drawback is that it is not free.
